<p>Because our wax is a hard wax the hair HAS to be the right length in order for you to get a good clean service. But if its much shorter than that the wax most likely wont be able to grip. The best thing to do is use hair clippers with a guard attachment that will quickly trim it to an even ¼ long before waxing. Short hair has little to no Plan B if their style goes south at the end of the day. If you have oily hair that is medium or short in length then hair wax is a great option for you when you compare gel vs wax.</p>

<p>Finding the best hair wax to keep a short hairstyle in place does not come without its challenges. Longer hairs tend to be thicker and tougher which can make them more difficult to remove. Most wax types require a lengthy period of allowing hair to grow in so that the wax can remove hair in every stage of the growth cycle. You can avoid some of these problems by simply taking off some length.

<p>Gel is best applied on damp hair after you shower as long as you arent palming your mane. If the hair is too short you wont cause any damage but the hair wont come out. This is one of the best hair products for short hair. If its longer than that theres always a chance that the hair strand will break mid-shaft. 19 Best Hair Color Wax Pink Hair Color Amonia Free Peroxide Free Hairdye Hairinspiration Haircolor Long Layered Bob Hairstyles Wavy Haircuts Hair Styles.</p>

<p>If your hair is longer I recommend shaving the area and booking your waxing appointment for two to three weeks later. The hair should be at least 14-inch to 12-inch for best results. Once the hair becomes finer it can be waxed at a shorter length. Itll be easier to get waxed or wax yourself with longer hair the results will be better and youll experience less irritation. 14 Premium Hair Color Light Golden Blonde Hair Color Wax Black Hairfashion Hairartist Haircolor Medium Hair Styles Hair Color Balayage Hair Styles.</p>
