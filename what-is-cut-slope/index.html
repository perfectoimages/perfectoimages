<p><strong>What Is Cut Slope</strong>, The major parameters in relation to design of cut slopes are the slope angle and height of the cut. 11 woud mean one foot horizontal for every foot of depth or 100 slope or 45 degree angle. Excavation with shoring is usually done when space is limited. The orientation of the cut slope fixes the exposure of the slope to the sw1 and therefore affects the number of cycles of freezing and thaw ing and wetting and drying per year.</p>
