<p>It frequently appears flat and lifeless and you may find yourself constantly teasing your roots to get a bit of volume. Style the hair to make it bottom-heavy. Straight hair is popular because it is easy to create different styles and looks it is also able to look neat tidy and well presented. Its easy to grow out. .</p>

<p>If your fine hair keeps falling flat theres a good chance youve been making these styling mistakes. And weird but I look like I have more hair because its all flat with no scalp showing through which I reallllllly like. I guess because its easier to manage. If your hair is relatively straight humidity in the air will probably cause your hair to frizz. .</p>
