<p>The pool chemicals can result in dry split ends which in turn can split all the way through the hair shaft. Your hair soaked up all the water from washing it before entering the pool. I have curly thick hair and brushing it is a nightmare. Chlorine is a bleach and it will cause hair pigment to lighten.
