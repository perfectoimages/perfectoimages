<p><strong>How Often Does The Average Person Get A Haircut</strong>, I cant even fathom a haircut every other week. Most men should get their hair cut about every five weeks whether they have closely cropped hair or a longer style. On average experts recommend waiting no more than twelve weeks to have your hair cut and individuals with short hair might need it cut as often as every four weeks. A guy spends around 2293 per trip while a woman spends more than twice that at 5434 per trip.</p>

Because hair grows so fast individuals need to schedule regular haircuts if they want to maintain the ideal look of their hair. On average experts recommend waiting no more than twelve weeks to have your hair cut and individuals with short hair might need it cut as often as every four weeks. Have you ever thought about how often should you cut your hair.
