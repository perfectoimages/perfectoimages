<p>Often mislabeled it seems many people have a hard time deciding if their cat is considered a short haired or a long haired cat. Twist that fine straight hair into a style thats fun to wear. Neither long and elongated or short and stubby it is in proportion to the strong yet agile looking body. Gently brushing their coat once or twice a week is usually sufficient to remove loose hair and minimize shedding.</p>

<p>Hold it in place with a light hold setting spray. My dog doesnt have a super heavy coat really although its not thin. If you have medium length hair with bangs brush the hair above the bangs straight back for that extra volume. A medium hairstyle is only expandable so much it offers a middle length but you cant always get away with different styles due to having too much hair in the case of a short hairstyle or your hair being. The outer coat or layer is usually short thick straight and rough in texture.</p>
