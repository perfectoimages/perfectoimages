<p><strong>Does Grey Hair Suit Everyone</strong>, Grey doesnt suit everyone warns Josh Wood founder and CEO of Josh Wood Colour. As I got older my hair thinned considerably and went a dismal patchy gray so that even with good styling it was impossible to imbue with any sort of elegance. Instead opt for lighter shades such as strawberry blonde or a copper toned blond. How can I go GREY without.</p>

<p>Its very common with clients who have dark hair who want to be lighter but hate any kind of orange tones and always ask for ashy hair to the point of it almost looking green. In many places it still is for men at least. Avoid dark tones as theyll leave you looking ghastly. In humans most gray hair is not related to stress. But our society still seems to have a collective issue with the natural aging process of the female human being so reaching for the dye as soon as the first silvery sprouts appear is de rigueur for the vast majority of women under the age of 60.</p>
