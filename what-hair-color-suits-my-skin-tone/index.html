The surface color of your skin tone or the first thing you see when you look in the mirror may appear ruddy but your undertone could be golden or yellow.

But perhaps even more importantly whether your hair hue came from your mothers side of the family or your favorite salon make sure your color suits your personality your outlook your attitude and the image you want to project out into the world.
