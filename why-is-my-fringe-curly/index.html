<p>How to look after it. I have an insane fringe that has a mind of its own. The side fringe looks great with layered or thinned hair and adds a bit of structure while maintaining the wild effect created by your curls. First do not touch the fringe as this could cause the products to be removed more easily and waves. Pin On My Own Creations.</p>
