<p>The most common way red hair happens is when both copies of a gene called MC1R are either not working or are off. I can offer several of my customers and my brother as proofs going from beautiful redauburn to a medium brown with reddish lights when seen in sunlight. - Yes my naturally red hair is darkening with age quite a lot actually when I looked at some old LHC pics I posted back in 2002 and like you said my gray hairs are particularly sparkly. 12 votes 22 comments.
