<p><strong>Why Does Straight Hair Not Look Good On Me</strong>, Because of this straight hair remains strong during aggressive brushing braiding or styling. People with naturally straight hair can skimp on the extra shine serum because the straight surface of the hair reflects more light can be smoother and thus shinier. Notice how anyone with curly hair when not straightened looks shorter than when it is straight. Seriously satisfying root volume and long mane dont really belong in the same sentence.</p>

<p>As someone with curly hair who always straightens it I think it gets labelled good hair because straight hair is usually silky and smooth it also looks longer as curly hair is frizzy tangles easy and looks shorter because of gravity. The longer your hair is the thinner and flatter it looks. Are you wearing it straight with a bend at the end or just pin straight because I dont like straight hair on me either it have to have a curl at the end because it makes my head look long lol. During the transition you assure yourself the issue will work itself out.</p>
