<p>A range of symptoms is related to upper airway resistance syndrome UARS. The consequences of long face syndrome are not merely aesthetic. Feeling as though youve always been sick Overreaction to bee stings and mosquito bites Shortness of breath Feeling lightheaded when you stand Insomnia Ringing of the ears Facial and chest flushing Frequent colds infections or fevers Food chemical and drug sensitivities and intolerances Heat intolerance.
