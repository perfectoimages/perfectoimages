<p>Geographically Korea is close to China and Japan but genes have some differences. In fact pore size is genetic and not something you can cleanse away. Australoid ancestry is absent among neighboring Northeast Asians such as the Koreans and NanaiUlchi while Y-DNA evidence suggests that haplogroup D the Jomon-Japanese haplogroup is largely absent in the Korean peninsula and other parts of Northeast Asia. Koreans also have the ABCC11 gene nearly universally so they have dry earwax as opposed to the wet earwax of most people in Europe the Middle East and Africa. However many Korean women desire more translucent and porcelain-like glass skin.</p>
