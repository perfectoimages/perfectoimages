<p>I recall that the stylist did a soft perm on me as my hair are soft and flimsy. Stylists always recommend that you wait at least a day although the gold standard is 48 hours before you can wet and shampoo permed hair. They have probably starred at their mirrors for hours imagining how they would look with permed hair. The only complaint is that the perming chemical killed my finer hair near the nape of my neck.

<p>Breakage Your hair will sweat out and much like new growth to a perm the difference in textures can cause breakage. A permanent chemical alteration is just that. Reply Was this helpful.
